# Global Air Quality Insights: A Visualization Dashboard

![Dashboard Header](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x200.png?text=Add+a+Banner+Image+of+Your+Dashboard+Here)

An interactive data visualization dashboard built with **HTML, CSS, and D3.js** to explore global air pollution data. This project analyzes and presents Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the top 15 countries with the most monitoring entries, highlighting pollutant levels and their impact on public health.

## üìñ Project Overview & Data Story

This project aims to provide a data-driven analysis of air quality by achieving three main objectives:
1.  **Identify** which countries and cities contribute the most to higher-risk AQI levels.
2.  **Examine** how different pollutants (CO, O‚ÇÉ, NO‚ÇÇ, and PM2.5) affect AQI categories.
3.  **Explore** comparative patterns and insights to guide potential policy or research actions.

## üöÄ Setup and Local Installation

To run this project locally, a simple local server is required to handle the `d3.csv()` data request due to browser security policies (CORS).

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/air-pollution-dashboard.git
    cd air-pollution-dashboard
    ```

2.  **Start a local server.** If you have Python installed, you can use its built-in server.
    -   For Python 3:
        ```bash
        python -m http.server
        ```
    -   For Python 2:
        ```bash
        python -m SimpleHTTPServer
        ```
    *You can also use the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension in VS Code.*

3.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## üìä Data Source

The data used in this project is from the `global_air_pollution_data.csv` dataset, which contains 23,036 AQI readings from various cities and countries. The dataset includes overall AQI values, pollutant-specific AQIs (CO, NO‚ÇÇ, O‚ÇÉ, PM2.5), and AQI categories (Good to Hazardous).
